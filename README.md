# Global_Deforestation
## Project from SQL nanodegree by Udacity
As a part of the course project, I used SQL to analyse the data to write a report on global deforestation.  
I used data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.
